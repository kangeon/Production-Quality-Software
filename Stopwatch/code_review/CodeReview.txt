AddressBook.java--------------
line 23: First line in javadoc of the class does not provide any meaningful 
         information.

line 44: The constructor throws an IllegalArgumentException but it is neither
         documented in javadoc nor caught and handled.
         
line 56: Prefer not return 0 on success. 

line 60: javadoc description should have proper punctuation.

line 66: Seems to be trying to adhere to 80 chars per line but this line is 81 
         chars. Thrown exception is not documented in javadoc.

line 74: The check is unnecessary. The following for loop would never get 
         executed if Contacts.size is 0 anyway.

line 92: toString implementation only provides Contact names. 
         Not a very good textual representation of an AddressBook.

line 120: this.search(keyWord) is not assigned to a reference, so the user 
          cannot use the results. Also, the Vector of Contacts returned by 
          search has different indexes than Vector of Contacts in AddressBook, 
          so the search does not provide any useful information to deleteEntry.

line 136: Prefer to log the error rather than return -1.
 
line 146: Details should be documented in javadoc.

line 151: Incomplete comment.

line 156: prefer not to return -1. Exception not documented in javadoc.

line 160: Do not understand purpose of trying to delete file. 
          It will only get there if the file does not exist.

line 247: Details should be documented in javadoc.

line 253: prefer not to return -1.

line 261: exception not documented in javadoc.

Contact.java------------------

line 5: Does not provide meaningful description.

line 7: use 3rd person in javadoc. 

line 18: Make String fields final. (So that the references are immutable)

line 26: prefer to initialize to null over empty String.

line 49: Builder methods return Builder object, not the contact.

line 128: prefer conventional naming for getter methods. (ie getPhoneNumber)
